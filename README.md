# Library-Management-System


The Library Management System is a software which handles the entire data of library. It makes the work of librarian very easy instead of writing data in a notebook. 

If librarian want’s to search for a particular book then that task was very time consuming. So to make this task easy the programming languages were developed and C++ language is one of them.
